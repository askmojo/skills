# Tweet Optimization

Transforms draft tweets into high-engagement versions optimized for X's algorithm.

## Quick Start

1. Provide your draft tweet or idea
2. Receive analysis of current strengths and friction points
3. Get 3 optimized versions (hook-focused, reply-maximizing, repost-optimizing)
4. Choose recommended version or hybrid

## How X's Algorithm Scores Tweets

The For You feed predicts engagement probabilities. Optimize for:

**Positive signals (maximize):**
- Likes, replies, reposts, quotes
- Clicks, dwell time, shares, follows

**Negative signals (avoid):**
- Not interested, block, mute, report

## Optimization Framework

### 1. Hook Engineering (First 7 Words)

- **Pattern interrupt:** Break expectations
- **Curiosity gap:** Open a loop that demands closing
- **Specificity:** Concrete beats abstract ("$47M" not "millions")
- **Contradiction:** Challenge assumed beliefs

### 2. Emotional Resonance

Target high-arousal emotions that drive action:
- Awe ("this changes everything")
- Anger (righteous, not toxic)
- Anxiety (FOMO, urgency)
- Surprise (unexpected reveals)
- Validation ("finally someone said it")

Avoid low-arousal states: sadness, contentment, boredom.

### 3. Reply Maximization

Build in reply triggers:
- Hot takes that demand response
- Questions (real or rhetorical)
- Intentional incompleteness ("but there's a catch...")
- Rankings that people want to argue with
- Polarizing framing on non-toxic topics

### 4. Repost Psychology

Make it identity-reinforcing:
- "This is the kind of person I am"
- Makes the sharer look smart/informed/funny
- Tribal signaling without being exclusionary
- Quotable standalone value

### 5. Dwell Time Optimization

- Information density that rewards re-reading
- Nested ideas that unfold
- Formatting that guides the eye
- Payoff that recontextualizes the hook

### 6. Negative Signal Avoidance

Never trigger:
- Spam patterns (excessive hashtags, @mentions, links in first tweet)
- Engagement bait that feels manipulative ("RETWEET IF...")
- Rage bait that makes people want to mute
- Cringe that embarrasses readers

## Output Format

For each input tweet, provide:

```
ORIGINAL: [their tweet]

ANALYSIS:
- Current engagement drivers: [what works]
- Friction points: [what hurts it]
- Emotional register: [current vs optimal]
- Missing elements: [opportunities]

OPTIMIZED VERSION 1 (Hook-focused):
[rewrite]
Why it works: [explanation]

OPTIMIZED VERSION 2 (Reply-maximizing):
[rewrite]
Why it works: [explanation]

OPTIMIZED VERSION 3 (Repost-optimizing):
[rewrite]
Why it works: [explanation]

RECOMMENDED: [which version + hybrid suggestions]

POSTING STRATEGY:
- Best time framing: [if relevant]
- Thread potential: [yes/no + why]
- Media recommendation: [image/video/none + why]
- Follow-up plays: [what to do after posting]
```

## Style Guidelines

- Write like a human, not a marketer
- Lowercase is fine if it fits the voice
- Short sentences. Punchy.
- No cringe corporate-speak
- Match the author's authentic voice while amplifying it
- Weird beats boring. Specific beats generic. Confident beats hedging.

## Example

**Input:** "We just launched our new product after 6 months of work"

**Analysis:**
- Current drivers: Milestone announcement, effort narrative
- Friction: Generic, no hook, passive voice
- Emotional register: Low (contentment) vs optimal (surprise/awe)
- Missing: Tension, specificity, curiosity gap

**Optimized Version 1 (Hook-focused):**
```
6 months ago we mass-deleted our codebase.

today we shipped the thing that almost killed us.
```
Why: Opens with unexpected action (pattern interrupt), creates narrative tension, "mass-" repetition creates rhythm.

**Optimized Version 2 (Reply-maximizing):**
```
we mass-resigned the team, mass-deleted the code, and mass-rebuilt from zero.

6 months later: we just shipped.

was it worth it? (thread below)
```
Why: Creates controversy ("mass-resigned?"), promises story, invites debate.

**Optimized Version 3 (Repost-optimizing):**
```
the product that almost killed us just shipped.

6 months of mass-deletes, mass-resignations, and mass-rebuilds.

here's the lesson nobody tells you about startup launches:
```
Why: Shareable insight framing, makes reposter look wise, promises valuable lesson.

**Recommended:** Version 1 for clean impact, or Version 3 if you have a thread ready.
