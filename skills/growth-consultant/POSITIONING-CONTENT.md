## LinkedIn Comment (Ready to Copy)

```
This prompt is solid for one-off strategic analysis.

I turned it into a reusable skill: github.com/askmojo/skills/tree/main/skills/growth-consultant

Works with ChatGPT/Claude, but even better with askmojo.ai:
- Set up your business context once (company, industry, challenges)
- Run strategic analysis anytime without re-explaining
- Integrated APIs for competitive research and market data
- Builds on previous analyses instead of starting from scratch

Prompts are good. Skills with context are better.

## Standalone LinkedIn Post - Version 1 (Story Format)

```
I used to pay $20K for strategic growth consulting.

Then I found this ChatGPT prompt that does 80% of it.

Then I realized: I was re-explaining my business every single time.

Same context:
- My company, industry, revenue model
- Current challenges, growth tactics
- Competitive landscape

Different every time:
- Copy-paste the prompt
- Fill in all the variables
- Hope the research is deep enough
- Get inconsistent depth

So I turned it into a skill.

Now my AI already knows:
✅ My business context
✅ Past strategic analyses
✅ What worked, what didn't
✅ Current priorities

I just say "analyze [opportunity]" and get consultant-grade strategic insights in 15 minutes.

Not a one-off prompt. A persistent strategic advisor.

The prompt that inspired this is going viral on LinkedIn (the "$20K growth consultant").

I converted it to a reusable skill with persistent context.

Generic version (works with ChatGPT/Claude): github.com/askmojo/skills/tree/main/skills/growth-consultant

Full system with integrated competitive research: askmojo.ai

Prompts are good. Skills with context are better.

## Standalone LinkedIn Post - Version 2 (Problem/Solution Format)

```
That "$20K growth consultant" ChatGPT prompt going viral?

It's brilliant. And it's missing something.

The prompt gives you:
✅ Competitive landscape analysis
✅ Opportunity gap identification
✅ Prioritized action recommendations

What it doesn't give you:
❌ Memory of your business context
❌ Building on previous analyses
❌ Integrated competitive research APIs
❌ Consistency across strategic decisions

You end up:
- Re-explaining your business every time
- Copy-pasting the entire framework
- Getting surface-level research
- Starting from scratch each analysis

Better approach: Turn it into a skill with persistent context.

I converted the viral prompt into a reusable skill:
- Setup your business context once
- Run strategic analysis on any opportunity
- Builds on past recommendations
- Integrated competitive research

Works with ChatGPT/Claude: github.com/askmojo/skills/tree/main/skills/growth-consultant

Best experience with integrated APIs: askmojo.ai

Prompts are good. Skills with context are better.

## Distribution Strategy

**Timing:**
1. **Day 1** (today): Comment on original viral post
2. **Day 3-4**: Post Version 1 (story format) when comment has engagement
3. **Day 7**: Post Version 2 (problem/solution) if Version 1 performed well

**Why this sequence:**
- Comment captures immediate viral traffic
- First post tells personal story (high engagement, builds rapport)
- Second post is more analytical (captures different audience segment)
- Spacing prevents fatigue, maximizes reach

**Engagement tactics:**
- Respond to comments on original post
- Tag Khizer Abbas when posting (credit original inspiration)
- Use LinkedIn hashtags: #AITools #Strategy #GrowthMarketing #BusinessStrategy
- Pin top-performing post to profile

---

## Response Templates

**If someone asks: "How is this different from the prompt?"**

```
Great question. The prompt is the framework - the skill is the framework + memory.

With the prompt:
- Every analysis, you re-explain your business
- No connection between analyses
- Manual research coordination

With the skill:
- Context persists (company, challenges, goals)
- Builds on previous strategic recommendations
- Integrated competitive research APIs

Same strategic thinking, better execution.

Want automated context management: askmojo.ai

**If someone asks: "Can I just use the original prompt?"**

```
Absolutely! The prompt works great for one-off analyses.

I built the skill version because I was doing strategic planning monthly and got tired of:
1. Re-pasting the entire prompt
2. Re-explaining my business context
3. Not having the AI reference previous analyses

If you only need it once, the prompt is perfect.

If you're doing ongoing strategic work, the skill saves 30-40 min per analysis and maintains consistency.

Both valid approaches - depends on your use case.

**If someone asks: "Do you work for AskMojo?"**

```
I'm building it! AskMojo is my project.

The open-source skills library (github.com/askmojo/skills) is free for anyone to use with ChatGPT/Claude.

It demonstrates the approach: persistent context > prompt engineering.

The commercial platform (askmojo.ai) adds automated context management, integrated APIs, and skill orchestration.

Open source builds the audience, commercial product serves those who want the automated version.
