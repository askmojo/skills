## Process

### Phase 1: Competitive Landscape Mapping

**Objective**: Understand who you're competing against and what they're doing.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify competitors**
   - 3-5 direct competitors (same product category, target audience)
   - 1-2 adjacent disruptors (different approach, overlapping customer needs)
   - Use web research, industry databases, user reviews

2. **Analyze each competitor**
   - **Positioning**: How they describe themselves, unique value prop
   - **Pricing**: Model (subscription, usage-based, freemium), price points, tiers
   - **Strategic moves**: Recent launches, acquisitions, partnerships, pivots
   - **Growth tactics**: SEO, paid ads, content, partnerships, virality

3. **Benchmark your tactics**
   - Compare your current approach to each competitor
   - Identify what's working in the market
   - Note where you're ahead or behind

**Output format:**
```

### Phase 2: Opportunity Gap Analysis

**Objective**: Find high-impact growth and profitability levers you're not currently using.

**Steps:**

1. **Compare tactics to market**
   - List all growth tactics competitors use
   - Identify tactics you're NOT using
   - Focus on proven tactics (evidence of success)

2. **Identify untapped levers** (find at least 5)

   **Growth levers:**
   - New customer acquisition channels
   - Viral/referral mechanics
   - Partnership opportunities
   - Geographic expansion
   - Product-led growth tactics
   - Community building
   - Content/SEO strategies

   **Profitability levers:**
   - Pricing optimization (increase prices, new tiers)
   - Upsell/cross-sell opportunities
   - Cost reduction (CAC, infrastructure, operations)
   - Retention improvements (reduce churn)
   - Usage-based pricing
   - Premium features/add-ons

3. **Assess each lever**

[Repeat for 5+ levers]
```

---

### Phase 3: Prioritized Action Planning

**Objective**: Recommend the top 3 actions with strongest ROI.

**Steps:**

1. **Score each opportunity**

   **Impact Score (1-5):**
   - 5 = Potentially 50%+ revenue/margin improvement
   - 4 = 20-50% improvement
   - 3 = 10-20% improvement
   - 2 = 5-10% improvement
   - 1 = <5% improvement

   **Feasibility Score (1-5):**
   - 5 = Can implement in <1 month with existing resources
   - 4 = 1-3 months, minimal new resources
   - 3 = 3-6 months, moderate resources
   - 2 = 6-12 months, significant resources
   - 1 = >12 months, major resources/risk

2. **Calculate priority**
   - Priority Score = Impact × Feasibility
   - Rank all opportunities by score
   - Select top 3 highest scores

3. **Create action plan for each**
   - Strategic rationale (why this matters)
   - Success metrics (how to measure)
   - First next step (concrete action to start)
   - Timeline estimate
   - Resource requirements
   - Key risks and mitigations

**Output format:**
```
## Prioritized Actions

| Opportunity | Impact | Feasibility | Priority | Expected Outcome |
|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| [Action 1]  | 5      | 4           | 20       | [Brief outcome]  |
| [Action 2]  | 4      | 5           | 20       | [Brief outcome]  |
| [Action 3]  | 5      | 3           | 15       | [Brief outcome]  |

### #1: [Top Priority Action]

**Strategic Rationale:**
[Why this is the highest priority move for your business right now]

**Success Metrics:**
- Primary: [Main KPI to track]
- Secondary: [Supporting metrics]
- Target: [Specific goal]

**Implementation Plan:**

**First Next Step:**
[Specific, actionable task you can start immediately]

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: [Initial phase]
- Month 1: [Milestone]
- Month 2-3: [Full implementation]

**Resources Needed:**
- Team: [Roles/people]
- Budget: [Estimated cost]
- Tools: [Technology/platforms]

**Key Risks:**
- [Risk 1]: [Mitigation strategy]
- [Risk 2]: [Mitigation strategy]

[Repeat for top 3 actions]
```

---

### Phase 4: Sources and Validation

**Objective**: Document research sources for verification.

**Steps:**

1. List all sources used in analysis
   - Competitor websites
   - Industry reports
   - News articles
   - Market research platforms
   - User reviews/forums
   - Financial filings (if public)

2. Include URLs or publication titles
3. Note confidence level for key claims
4. Flag assumptions where data is limited

**Output format:**
```
## Sources

1. [Competitor 1] website: [URL]
2. [Industry Report]: [Publication and date]
3. [News article about strategic move]: [URL]
4. [Market research]: [Platform and data point]
5. [User reviews]: [Platform]

[Continue numbered list for all sources]

## Assumptions and Limitations

- [Where data was unavailable]
- [Estimates based on industry benchmarks]
- [Areas requiring further research]
```

---

## Anti-Slop Guidelines

**DO:**
- Be specific with competitor names, tactics, and data
- Use real numbers when available (revenue, pricing, metrics)
- Cite sources for claims
- Admit when data is unavailable
- Focus on actionable insights
- Prioritize ruthlessly (top 3 only)

**DON'T:**
- Use vague language ("consider exploring", "might be beneficial")
- List generic tactics without market evidence
- Make unsubstantiated claims about competitors
- Recommend everything (focus beats breadth)
- Skip the prioritization scoring
- Ignore feasibility constraints

---

[3 more opportunities...]

## Prioritized Actions

| Opportunity | Impact | Feasibility | Priority | Expected Outcome |
|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Chrome Extension | 4 | 5 | 20 | 10K+ installs in 6 months |
| Public Skills Marketplace | 5 | 3 | 15 | Viral distribution channel |
| Usage-based pricing tier | 4 | 4 | 16 | 30% ARPU increase |

### #1: Chrome Extension for Web Context Capture

**Strategic Rationale:**
Your key differentiator is persistent context, but capturing context is manual. Competitors with extensions have 10x higher engagement. This is the fastest path to making your product "sticky" and increasing daily usage, which drives retention and conversion.

**Success Metrics:**
- Primary: Extension installs (target: 5K in month 1, 10K in month 6)
- Secondary: DAU/MAU ratio (target: increase from 15% to 40%)
- Conversion metric: Extension users convert 2x higher to paid

**Implementation Plan:**

**First Next Step:**
Spec out MVP extension features this week - focus on: (1) one-click save to workspace, (2) auto-capture page context, (3) quick skill invocation. Ship within 30 days.

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Extension MVP development + internal testing
- Week 3: Submit to Chrome Web Store, create launch content
- Week 4: Launch to existing users, Product Hunt post
- Month 2-3: Iterate based on usage data, add advanced features

**Resources Needed:**
- Team: 1 frontend dev (full-time for 4 weeks)
- Budget: $2K (Chrome developer account, any tools needed)
- Tools: Chrome Extension API, existing React codebase

**Key Risks:**
- Chrome Store rejection: Mitigate with thorough privacy/permissions review
- Low adoption: Mitigate with in-app prompts + onboarding flow
- Maintenance burden: Keep feature set minimal in V1

[Action #2 and #3...]

## Sources

1. Notion AI pricing: https://www.notion.so/pricing
2. Mem.ai Series A announcement: TechCrunch, October 2023
3. Chrome Web Store stats: SimilarWeb competitor extension data
4. Zapier marketplace metrics: Zapier blog post on Zap sharing
5. Usage-based pricing research: OpenView Partners SaaS benchmarks

## Assumptions and Limitations

- Chrome extension install estimates based on comparable productivity tools (Grammarly, Notion)
- Pricing impact assumes similar willingness-to-pay as Notion AI tier
- Viral coefficient estimates from Zapier/IFTTT case studies
```

---

## Why This Works Better Than a Prompt

**Prompts require:**
- Re-explaining your business every time
- Re-pasting the full framework for each analysis
- Inconsistent depth (depends on how you frame the question)
- No learning from previous analyses
- Manual research coordination

**This skill provides:**
- Persistent context about your business, challenges, goals
- Consistent strategic framework applied each time
- Deep research (systematically checks 100+ sources)
- Builds on previous analyses (references past recommendations)
- Actionable outputs with clear next steps

**Time savings:**
- Prompt approach: 45-60 min per analysis (setup + iteration)
- Skill approach: 15-20 min per analysis (just specify focus area)
- **Saves 30-40 min per use**, maintains consistency across multiple strategic questions

---

## Notes

- This skill excels at **strategy, not execution** - use for planning, not implementation details
- Best used **quarterly** for comprehensive analysis, **monthly** for specific opportunity deep-dives
- Combine with other skills: Use `/competitive-ads-extractor` for ad intelligence, `/content-research` for market education analysis
- **Update context regularly** - as your business evolves, update challenges and focus areas
