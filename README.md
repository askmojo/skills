# AskMojo Skills

**Reusable, context-aware AI skills that remember your business.**

Stop copy-pasting prompts. Build skills that work repeatedly with your context.

---

## The Difference

**Prompts** (traditional approach):
- Copy-paste every time you need them
- Re-explain your context, voice, preferences
- Generic outputs that don't know your business
- Prompt engineering as ongoing overhead

**Skills** (AskMojo approach):
- Build once, reuse forever
- Provide context once, use repeatedly
- Consistent outputs aligned with your goals
- Focus on work, not prompt crafting

---

## Philosophy

> **"Prompts are good. Skills with memory are better."**

We believe AI should amplify your expertise, not require you to become a prompt engineer. These skills are designed to:

1. **Work repeatedly** - Use the same skill over and over
2. **Accept your context** - Business goals, brand voice, constraints
3. **Stay consistent** - Outputs align with your strategy
4. **Save time** - Stop re-explaining, start executing

## How to Use

### Option 1: AskMojo (Recommended)

**Best experience with [askmojo.ai](https://askmojo.ai):**

1. **Import skills** - Add any skill from this library to your AskMojo workspace
2. **Set up context once:**
   - Your business goals & priorities
   - Target audience profiles
   - Brand voice & tone guidelines
   - Past examples & preferences
3. **Run with one command** - `/skill-name [input]`
4. **Context auto-loads** - Every skill uses your context automatically

**Why AskMojo is better:**
- ✅ **Setup once, use everywhere** - Context shared across all skills
- ✅ **Integrated APIs** - Built-in web research, image generation, data analysis
- ✅ **No repetition** - Never re-explain your business context
- ✅ **Learns from edits** - Outputs improve based on your feedback
- ✅ **Tool orchestration** - Skills can call other skills and APIs

### Option 2: ChatGPT / Claude (Manual)

**If you prefer using ChatGPT/Claude directly:**

Each skill contains:
- Clear purpose and use cases
- Step-by-step instructions
- Context requirements (what to provide)
- Output format examples
- Tool integration options

**Steps:**
1. Browse skills below
2. Open the skill's `SKILL.md` file
3. Read the context requirements
4. Provide your context to ChatGPT/Claude (copy-paste each time)
5. Follow the skill instructions
6. Get outputs (quality depends on context you provide)

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Must re-provide context for every chat
- ❌ No persistent memory across skills
- ❌ Manual API integrations (research, images, data)
- ❌ No learning from your edits

**This works, but it's slower.** If you use skills regularly, consider [askmojo.ai](https://askmojo.ai) for persistent context.
