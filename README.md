# AskMojo Skills

**Reusable, context-aware AI skills that remember your business.**

Stop copy-pasting prompts. Build skills that work repeatedly with your context.

---

## The Difference

**Prompts** (traditional approach):
- Copy-paste every time you need them
- Re-explain your context, voice, preferences
- Generic outputs that don't know your business
- Prompt engineering as ongoing overhead

**Skills** (AskMojo approach):
- Build once, reuse forever
- Provide context once, use repeatedly
- Consistent outputs aligned with your goals
- Focus on work, not prompt crafting

## Philosophy

> **"Prompts are good. Skills with memory are better."**

We believe AI should amplify your expertise, not require you to become a prompt engineer. These skills are designed to:

1. **Work repeatedly** - Use the same skill over and over
2. **Accept your context** - Business goals, brand voice, constraints
3. **Stay consistent** - Outputs align with your strategy
4. **Save time** - Stop re-explaining, start executing

## How to Use

### For ChatGPT / Claude Users

Each skill contains:
- Clear purpose and use cases
- Step-by-step instructions
- Context requirements (what to provide)
- Output format examples
- Tool integration options

**Steps:**
1. Browse skills below
2. Open the skill's `SKILL.md` file
3. Read the context requirements
4. Provide your context to ChatGPT/Claude
5. Follow the skill instructions
6. Get consistent, reusable outputs

**Note:** Without a persistent context system, you'll need to re-provide context each time. Consider building or using a system like [AskMojo](https://askmojo.com) for automated context management.
