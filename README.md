# AskMojo Skills

**Reusable, context-aware AI skills that remember your business.**

Stop copy-pasting prompts. Build skills that work repeatedly with your context.

---

## The Difference

**Prompts** (traditional approach):
- Copy-paste every time you need them
- Re-explain your context, voice, preferences
- Generic outputs that don't know your business
- Prompt engineering as ongoing overhead

**Skills** (AskMojo approach):
- Build once, reuse forever
- Provide context once, use repeatedly
- Consistent outputs aligned with your goals
- Focus on work, not prompt crafting

---

## Philosophy

> **"Prompts are good. Skills with memory are better."**

We believe AI should amplify your expertise, not require you to become a prompt engineer. These skills are designed to:

1. **Work repeatedly** - Use the same skill over and over
2. **Accept your context** - Business goals, brand voice, constraints
3. **Stay consistent** - Outputs align with your strategy
4. **Save time** - Stop re-explaining, start executing

#### Comparison Table

| Method | Setup Time | Reusability | Best For |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **AskMojo** | 10 min once | ⭐⭐⭐ Perfect | Regular use, multiple skills, integrated APIs |
| **Claude Projects** | 5 min/skill | ⭐⭐ Good | Organized workflows, large context |
| **Custom GPTs** | 10 min/skill | ⭐⭐ Good | Specialized tasks, file knowledge |
| **Custom Instructions** | 5 min once | ⭐ Limited | Simple universal preferences |
| **Memory** | First use | ⭐ Variable | Automatic learning over time |
| **Manual (paste each time)** | Every chat | ❌ None | One-off tasks only |

---

#### Limitations of Manual Approach

**What you'll deal with:**
- ❌ Must re-provide context for every new chat (or set up per skill)
- ❌ No persistent memory across different skills
- ❌ Manual API integrations (web research, images, data analysis)
- ❌ No automatic learning from your edits
- ❌ Context window limits (Claude: 200K tokens, ChatGPT: 32K tokens)

**This works, but requires more setup.** If you use skills regularly, consider [askmojo.ai](https://askmojo.ai) for:
- Persistent context across ALL skills (setup once)
- Integrated APIs (research, image generation, data analysis)
- Automatic learning and improvement
- Unlimited context (no token limits per skill)
